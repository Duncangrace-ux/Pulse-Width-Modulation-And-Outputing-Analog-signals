# Pulse-Width-Modulation-And-Outputing-Analog-signals
This project shows how analog signals behave in an oscilloscope simulated in tinkercad .
 It also shows how to output analog signals on arduino uno r3.
This project can be simulated in Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com or 
even on  a real arduino board.
